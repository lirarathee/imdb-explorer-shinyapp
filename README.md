IMDb Explorer Shiny App

Overview:

This is a shiny app that allows users to learn more about movies from a subset of the [IMDb Top Movies List] (https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?sort=rk,asc&mode=simple&page=1). Users can select a year and a movie, and then view the poster image, ranking, rating, director, and synopsis for that movie.

The accompanying code shows how the data was scraped from the web, as well as how the app was constructed.
